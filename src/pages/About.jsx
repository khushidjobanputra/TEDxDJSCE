              TEDxDJSCE is an independently organized TED event, consisting of a
              series of short, carefully curated talks that cover a wide range
              of topics - from science and technology to pressing global issues.
              Our event aims to give inspired thinkers a platform to put forth
              their ideas and expose students to new, emerging perspectives on a
              diverse range of topics that spark conversation and communication.
              We strive to create an inclusive space that amplifies ideas from
              various disciplines, backgrounds, and experiences.

              innovative solutions and a deeper understanding of the world
              around us. TEDxDJSCE is more than just a series of talks; it's an

            In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program
            called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that
            bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is
            called TEDxDJSCE, where x = independently organized TED event. At
            our TEDxDJSCE event, TED Talks and interaction with professionals
            from different fields will combine to spark deep discussion and
            connection with the audience. The TED Conference provides general
            guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including
            ours, are self-organized.
